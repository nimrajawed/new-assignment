    <h1><i>Chicken Karahi</i></h1>
    <h3>INSTRUCTIONS:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat a large, heavy-bottomed pan over high heat, and add the ghee and oil. Once hot, add the onions and
            sauté for 5-6 minutes, or until lightly golden. Add garlic, ginger, and whole green chili pepper and sauté
            for about a minute.</li>
        <li>Add the chicken and ½ tsp salt and sauté for 5 minutes, or until the color of the chicken changes and it has
            stopped releasing water. Add the tomatoes, coriander, cumin, red chili pepper, and remaining salt and sauté
            for another minute.</li>
        <li>Lower the heat to medium, cover, and allow the chicken cook for 20 minutes, stirring once in between.></li>
        <li>Uncover and raise the heat to high. Sauté for 10 minutes to finish cooking the chicken and reduce excess
            liquid.* You will notice the chicken taking on a glossy appearance as the ghee/oil starts to separate.</li>
        <li>Lower the heat to medium, add in the whisked yogurt, and gently sauté for 2-3 minutes. Taste and add more
            salt, if needed. (I usually need another 1/8 tsp.) Add freshly ground black peppercorns and garam masala,
            and stir to combine. Top with green chili peppers, julienned ginger, and cilantro. Serve hot with roti,
            naan, bread, or rice.</li>
    </ol>
